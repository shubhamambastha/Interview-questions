## Question:

You are given an integer array A of size N.
You have to pick B elements in total. Some (possibly 0) elements from left end of array A and some (possibly 0) from the right end of array A to get the maximum sum.
Find and return this maximum possible sum.

**Problem Constraints:**

```
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= B <= N
-103 <= A[i] <= 103
```

### Example:

```
Example 1:-
A = [5, -2, 3 , 1, 2];
B = 3;
ans = 8;

Example 2:-
A = [1, 2];
B = 1;
ans = 2;
```
