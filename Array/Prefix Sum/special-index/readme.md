## Question:

Given an array, arr[] of size N, the task is to find the count of array indices such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal.

**Problem Constraints:**

```
1 <= n <= 105
-105 <= A[i] <= 105
```

### Example:

```
Example 1:-
A = [2, 1, 6, 4];
ans = 1;

Example 2:-
A = [1, 1, 1];
ans = 3;
```
