## Question:

Given N array elements, rotate array from first to last (left to right) by k times;
Expected: SC = O(1)

**Problem Constraints:**

```
1 <= |A| <= 10^6
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
1 <= k <= 10^9
```

---

### Example:

```
Example 1:-
arr[5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; k = 2
ans = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2];

Example 2:-
arr[3] = [ 1, 2, 2 ]; k = 1
ans = [ 2, 2, 1 ];
```
