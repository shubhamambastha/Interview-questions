## Question:

Given N array elements, rotate array from last to first (right to left) by k times;
Expected: SC = O(1)

**Problem Constraints:**

```
1 <= |A| <= 106
1 <= A[i] <= 109
1 <= k <= 109
```

---

### Example:

```
Example 1:-
arr[4] = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]; k = 2
ans = [ 3, 4, 1, 2 ];

Example 2:-
arr[3] = [ 1, 2, 2 ]; k = 3
ans = [ 1, 2, 2 ];
```
