## Question:

Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, you have to find all the leaders in array A.
An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.
NOTE:The rightmost element is always a leader.

**Problem Constraints:**

```
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^8
```

### Example:

```
Example 1:-
A = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2];
ans = [17, 2, 5];

Example 2:-
A = [1, 2];
ans = [2];
```
